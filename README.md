# WinPatrol

## Main Script
### Located In the WinPatrol Folder
A script written during my time competing in the CyberPatriot competition to automatically configure basic Windows security issues and user configurations. Main.bat is the main file that runs all the other modular sub-scripts. This script was written to target Windows 8 and Windows 10 versions. Compatibility with Windows 11 and Server 2019 has not been tested.
